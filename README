# Personal Budget & Expense Tracker (Finance Sector)

## Project Overview:
This is a Python-based application using Tkinter to simulate a personal expense tracking tool. It allows users to log financial transactions (expenses) with a date, amount, category, and description, and maintains a running simulated balance. This project emphasizes data integrity, validation, and accurate financial calculation.

## Features:
1. **Input Validation:** Enforces that the transaction amount is positive and numeric.
2. **Date Integrity:** Validates that the date is in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format and prevents logging future transactions.
3. **Core Calculation:** Calculates and displays the running simulated balance (total expenses).
4. **Transaction Log:** Displays a detailed list of all recorded transactions.

## Installation:
1. Python 3.x required.
2. Dependencies: `tkinter` (comes with standard Python installation).
3. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Testing Focus (Black Box):
The application supports Black Box Testing with a focus on:
* **Financial Data Integrity:** Correct amount and date validation (especially boundary conditions like amount=0).
* **Calculation Accuracy:** Verification of the running total after sequential transactions.
* **Error Handling:** Testing for non-numeric inputs and incorrect date formats.
